## 👋 Hey there! I’m Mudassir Ali

I’m a DevOps engineer on a journey to master **Cloud Infrastructure** and **Automation**. Currently, I'm diving deep into **Infrastructure as Code** and **Advanced Kubernetes Patterns**. Every day, I'm building skills to turn complex deployment challenges into smooth, reliable workflows.

### 🌟 A Little About Me
- **🚀 Actively Exploring**: Advanced Kubernetes techniques, IaC with Terraform and Ansible
- **🤝 Looking to Collaborate**: If it’s about **DevOps tools** or **Cloud-Native projects**, count me in!
- **⚡ Fun Fact**: When I’m not in “automation mode,” you’ll find me experimenting with new tech stacks, reading up on the latest in DevOps, or brainstorming solutions for fun personal projects.
